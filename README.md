# Udacity: Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree Programme

### *Date created:*
10th January 2023

### *Project Title:*
Explore BikeShare Data with R

### *Description:*
In this project, we used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC using R. We explored different areas of the dataset such as : <br>
a) Popular times of travel - What is the most common month, day of week, hour of day?<br>
b) Popular stations and trips - What is the most common start station, end station, common trip from start to end?<br>
c) Trip Duration - What is the total travel time, average travel time for users in different cities? <br>
d) User info - What are the counts of each user type, each gender, the earliest, most recent, most common year of birth etc.?<br>

### *Files used:*
3 .CSV files used are: chicago.csv, new-york-city.csv, washington.csv

### *About Dataset:*
All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns: <br>
* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57) <br>
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)<br>
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)<br>
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)<br>
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)<br>
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)<br>

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:<br>
* Gender<br>
* Birth Year<br>
