### *Date created:*
10th January 2023

### *Project Title:*
Explore BikeShare Data with R

### *Description:*
In this project, we used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. We compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC using R. We explored different areas of the dataset such as : <br>
a) Popular times of travel - What is the most common month, day of week, hour of day?<br>
b) Popular stations and trips - What is the most common start station, end station, common trip from start to end?<br>
c) Trip Duration - What is the total travel time, average travel time for users in different cities? <br>
d) User info - What are the counts of each user type, each gender, the earliest, most recent, most common year of birth etc.?<br>


### *Files used:*
3 .CSV files named: chicago.csv, new-york-city.csv, washington.csv

### *Credits:*
a) YouTube video Tutorials by 'The Coding Train' and <br>
